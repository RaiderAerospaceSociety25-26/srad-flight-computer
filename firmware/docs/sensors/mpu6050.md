# MPU6050 Notes

What it provides
- 3-axis accelerometer (g), 3-axis gyroscope (deg/s), temperature (C)

Project usage
- Reader task: `src/sensor_imu2.cpp`
- Public API: `include/sensor_imu2.h`
- I2C addresses: 0x68 (default), 0x69 as alternate

Configuration
- Ranges set in code: accel = ±8 g, gyro = ±500 dps, filter = 21 Hz (see sensor_imu2.cpp)
- Convert m/s² → g and rad/s → deg/s in code

Considerations
- No magnetometer; do not derive yaw without external reference.
- Temperature affects biases; consider bias vs temp characterization if needed.
