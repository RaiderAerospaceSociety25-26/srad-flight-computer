# BMP390 Notes

What it provides
- Pressure (Pa), temperature (C), altitude estimate (m) via standard barometric formula

Project usage
- Reader task/API: `include/sensor_bmp390.h` and its .cpp in src/

Considerations
- Altitude depends on sea-level pressure (`SEALEVELPRESSURE_HPA` in `include/app_config.h`).
- Filter/baro oversampling can be tuned for noise vs response.
- When multiple altitude sources exist, record `source_id` in telemetry to identify provenance.
